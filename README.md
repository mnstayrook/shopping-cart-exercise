# Title: Shopping Cart Exercise
 
_Created by Maegan Stayrook_

Description:
A useful exercise through MIT MERN Full Stack course to create a virtual shopping experience, complete with removing, adding, and restocking items. React, Strapi, Postman, and Axios were used in the creation of this experimental app.

How to Run:
1. Click "Submit" below the item you want to move into the cart.
2. To remove, click on the item in the cart and click the "Remove Product" button.
3. To add more items, click the "ReStock Products" button.

NOTE: you need at least React installed. To use the ReStock Products button, you need to set up Strapi, as well.
Postman was used to add additional items to the list without altering the code or adding on Strapi.

Roadmap:
- Make the platform more user-friendly.
- Add better item descriptions.
- Incorporate this sort of functionality into a real website.
